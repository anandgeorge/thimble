## Introduction ##

Thimble is middleware for express that simplifies modern web development. 

<!-- Web development changes everyday. It seems that there is always a new language to learn or technique to apply. We add tools and scripts to use and manage these new features. Tools like folder watchers, preprocessors, and build scripts. These tools allow us to develop fastebut at some point it's the tools that need to be managed. This is when development slows down.

Thimble aims to address this problem. How do we take advantage of these fantastic innovations, without over-complicating our workflow?




our development process is constantly changing. We build  to manage our new stack. 

Thimble focuses on two areas: development speed and runtime efficiency. 


It may seem small, but each of these tools adds complexity to your application, 
makes it just a little harder to maintain.


 somewhere along the way, we lost the refresh-result, instant feedback that makes web development so rewarding and addicting.



New tools, languages and techniques are released everyday that drive the web forward. To manage all this innovation, -->

Our field moves fast. Every day there is some new language to learn or technique to apply. It seems like we're always adding tools to our workflow to take advantage of these new features. Generally, these tools help us build better products faster. 

However, each time we add a new tool, we add just a little bit more complexity. Maybe just one more step. But these steps add up and if we're not careful the tools we put in place to move faster may need their own tools just to manage the growing complexity. This is when web development slows down.

Thimble is an attempt to break free from this destructive cycle and take advantage of all these fantastic innovations, while keeping the same development speed that we love. By adding an HTML parser to the development cycle, we can manipulate our response on the fly, allowing us to dynamically embed templates, compile languages, minify assets, and much more.
